# ObjectGraphChangeStatusAssessment
TODO add more details


Purpose
Use to assess the changes between to object trees or graphs.

Its as simple as configurating an Assessment object and then asking it to assess one object and another.

This can be useful when working with disconnected requests and needing to compare your entities.

In the future I plan to add module to help with EF, maybe following a pattern like Julie Lerman describes here:
